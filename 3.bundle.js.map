Text mining provides a collection of techniques that allows us to derive actionable insights from unstructured data. In this course, we explore the basics of text mining using the bag of words method. The first three chapters introduce a variety of essential topics for analyzing and visualizing text data. The final chapter allows you to apply everything you've learned in a real-world case study to extract insights from employee reviews of two major tech companies.\",\n     \"time\":\"4 hours\",\n     \"chapters\":[\n        {\n           \"title\":\"\\n          Jumping into text mining with bag of words\\n        \",\n           \"index\":\"1\",\n           \"description\":\"\\n    In this chapter, you'll learn the basics of using the bag of words method for analyzing text data.\\n  \",\n           \"parts\":[\n              \"What is text mining?\",\n              \"Understanding text mining\",\n              \"Quick taste of text mining\",\n              \"Getting started\",\n              \"Load some text\",\n              \"Make the vector a VCorpus object (1)\",\n              \"Make the vector a VCorpus object (2)\",\n              \"Make a VCorpus from a data frame\",\n              \"Cleaning and preprocessing text\",\n              \"Common cleaning functions from tm\",\n              \"Cleaning with qdap\",\n              \"All about stop words\",\n              \"Intro to word stemming and stem completion\",\n              \"Word stemming and stem completion on a sentence\",\n              \"Apply preprocessing steps to a corpus\",\n              \"The TDM & DTM\",\n              \"Understanding TDM and DTM\",\n              \"Make a document-term matrix\",\n              \"Make a term-document matrix\"\n           ]\n        },\n        {\n           \"title\":\"\\n          Word clouds and more interesting visuals\\n        \",\n           \"index\":\"\\n\\n  \\n    \\n  \\n\\n\",\n           \"description\":\"\\n    This chapter will teach you how to visualize text data in a way that's both informative and engaging.\\n  \",\n           \"parts\":[\n              \"Common text mining visuals\",\n              \"Test your understanding of text mining\",\n              \"Frequent terms with tm\",\n              \"Frequent terms with qdap\",\n              \"Intro to word clouds\",\n              \"A simple word cloud\",\n              \"Stop words and word clouds\",\n              \"Plot the better word cloud\",\n              \"Improve word cloud colors\",\n              \"Use prebuilt color palettes\",\n              \"Other word clouds and word networks\",\n              \"Find common words\",\n              \"Visualize common words\",\n              \"Visualize dissimilar words\",\n              \"Polarized tag cloud\",\n              \"Visualize word networks\",\n              \"Teaser: simple word clustering\"\n           ]\n        },\n        {\n           \"title\":\"\\n          Adding to your tm skills\\n        \",\n           \"index\":\"\\n\\n  \\n    \\n  \\n\\n\",\n           \"description\":\"\\n    In this chapter, you'll learn more basic text mining techniques based on the bag of words method.\\n  \",\n           \"parts\":[\n              \"Simple word clustering\",\n              \"Test your understanding of text mining\",\n              \"Distance matrix and dendrogram\",\n              \"Make a dendrogram friendly TDM\",\n              \"Put it all together: a text-based dendrogram\",\n              \"Dendrogram aesthetics\",\n              \"Using word association\",\n              \"Getting past single words\",\n              \"N-gram tokenization\",\n              \"Changing n-grams\",\n              \"How do bigrams affect word clouds?\",\n              \"Different frequency criteria\",\n              \"Changing frequency weights\",\n              \"Capturing metadata in tm\"\n           ]\n        },\n        {\n           \"title\":\"\\n          Battle of the tech giants for talent\\n        \",\n           \"index\":\"\\n\\n  \\n    \\n  \\n\\n\",\n           \"description\":\"\\n    This chapter ties everything together with a case study in text mining for HR analytics.\\n  \",\n           \"parts\":[\n              \"Amazon vs. Google\",\n              \"Organizing a text mining project\",\n              \"Step 1: Problem definition\",\n              \"Step 2: Identifying the text sources\",\n              \"Step 3: Text organization\",\n              \"Text organization\",\n              \"Working with Google reviews\",\n              \"Steps 4 & 5: Feature extraction & analysis\",\n              \"Feature extraction & analysis: amzn_pros\",\n              \"Feature extraction & analysis: amzn_cons\",\n              \"amzn_cons dendrogram\",\n              \"Word association\",\n              \"Quick review of Google reviews\",\n              \"Cage match!

What differentiates them are the genes that are active at any given time. Which genes these are is determined by a complex system of proteins that can activate and deactivate genes. When this regulatory machinery gets out of control, it can lead to cancer and other debilitating diseases. ChIP-seq analysis allows us to understand the function of regulatory proteins, how they can contribute to disease and can provide insights into how we may be able to intervene to prevent cells from spinning out of control.

During the course, you will explore classic SEM datasets, such as the Holzinger and Swineford (1939) and Bollen (1989) datasets. You will also work through a multi-factor model case study using the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale. Following this course, you will be able to dive into your data and gain a much deeper understanding of how it all fits together.\",\n     \"time\":\"4 hours\",\n     \"chapters\":[\n        {\n           \"title\":\"\\n          One-Factor Models\\n        \",\n           \"index\":\"1\",\n           \"description\":\"\\n    In this chapter, you will dive into creating your first structural equation model with lavaan.

More specifically, we introduce the idea of featurization such that network features can be added to non-network features as such boosting the performance of any resulting analytical model. In this course, you will use the igraph package to generate and label a network of customers in a churn setting and learn about the foundations of network learning. Then, you will learn about homophily, dyadicity and heterophilicty, and how these can be used to get key exploratory insights in your network. Next, you will use the functionality of the igraph package to compute various network features to calculate both node-centric as well as neighbor based network features.
