Regardless of the background, there will be times when a particular algorithm is implemented in one language and not the other, a feature is better documented, or simply, the tutorial you found online uses Python instead of R. In either case, this would require the R user to work in Python to get his/her work done, or try to understand how something is implemented in Python for it to be translated into R. This course helps you cross the R-Python language barrier.\",\n     \"time\":\"5 hours\",\n     \"chapters\":[\n        {\n           \"title\":\"\\n          The Basics\\n        \",\n           \"index\":\"1\",\n           \"description\":\"\\n    Learn about some of the most important data types (integers, floats, strings, and booleans) and data structures (lists, dictionaries, numpy arrays, and pandas DataFrames) in Python and how they compare to the ones in R. \\n  \",\n           \"parts\":[\n              \"Introduction\",\n              \"Assignment and data types\",\n              \"Arithmetic with strings\",\n              \"Containers\",\n              \"Lists\",\n              \"Dictionaries\",\n              \"Functions, Methods, and Libraries\",\n              \"Methods\",\n              \"NumPy arrays\",\n              \"Pandas DataFrames\"\n           ]\n        },\n        {\n           \"title\":\"\\n          Control flow, Loops, and Functions\\n        \",\n           \"index\":\"\\n\\n  \\n    \\n  \\n\\n\",\n           \"description\":\"\\n    This chapter covers control flow statements (if-else if-else), for loops and shows you how to write your own functions in Python!\\n  \",\n           \"parts\":[\n              \"Control flow and loops\",\n              \"Control flow\",\n              \"Loops\",\n              \"Functions\",\n              \"Individual binge drinking function\",\n              \"General binge drinking function\",\n              \"Lambda functions\",\n              \"Comprehensions\",\n              \"Mapping functions\",\n              \"List comprehension\",\n              \"Dictionary comprehension\"\n           ]\n        },\n        {\n           \"title\":\"\\n          Pandas\\n        \",\n           \"index\":\"\\n\\n  \\n    \\n  \\n\\n\",\n           \"description\":\"\\n    In this chapter you will learn more about one of the most important Python libraries, Pandas.
